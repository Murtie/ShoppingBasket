ISSUE ONE
Basket.cs
Not following SOLID Design Principles
Not open for extension but open for modification - OCP Fail
Not following Dependency Inversion Principle - tightly coupled with BasketItem Class

FIX ONE
IBasket created as an Interface to meet certain SOLID Design Principles
OCP Pass

ISSUE TWO
BasketItem.cs
Not following SOLID Design Principles
Not open for extension but open for modification - OCP Fail
Creates dependency on this Class wherever referenced - DIP Fail

FIX TWO
IBasketItem created as an Interface to remove DIP between Basket and BasketItem
References to BasketItem replaced with IBasketItem in Basket class

ISSUE THREE
IBasket.cs
Currently fails on Interface Segregation Principle as it is forcing more than one method

FIX THREE
IBasketTotal created as an Interface to remove the ISP issue - IBasket interface is no longer 
forcing multiple methods

ISSUE FOUR
Magic strings in TotalwithDiscount method.
Basket class Fails on OCP SOLID Principle

FIX FOUR
Converting business logic into objects by using Strategy Design Pattern, will help remove the logic out of the class. 
This will help achieve OCP SOLID Principle. 
Creating and IPromoOffer interface with a calculate discount function based on the offer.
It should also check if the product is eligible for discount
This function should return the total applicable discount for that particular offer.
Dependency Inversion Princple implemented by not assigning a class parameter to the constructor of PromoOfferDiscountCalculator class.
Concrete class created for the first offer PromoOfferHalfOffBreadForTwoButters
New non-class parameterised constructor created of Basket class to allow Dependency Injection
